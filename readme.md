We plan on building on our previous Covid-19 project by adding machine learning algorithms. We hope to develop a predictive model that will give us insight into how the virus will continues to affect our world.

Data sources:
Johns Hopkins Covid dataset
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/master/us-counties.csv
Industry data
Texas Health & Human Services / Texas Department of State Health Services - specific data on Texas infection and fatalities

Focusing on USA and Texas data

Technologies used:

Dash
Postgres Database server on AWS


~Clustering by location or industry
Regression into our Dashboard

Classification algorithms to determine wether social distancing / mandatory mask policies have been effective or not. We'll have to take into account the 2 week incubation time.

Density leading contributing factor to covid infection and fatality?



End User interaction
We plan on making our model interactive by allowing the end user select the location of the visualizations so the end user can see how covid is progressing in certain locations and predict how covid will progress in the future.
